If you want to change number of alters, you need to change the nodefunction.js and the numalters in the shownext.js, also change text in slides and index as well.

If you remove a slide from slides.js, edit nodefunctions.js, keypress.js] and shownext.js respectively.7
Also make sure when deleting in shownext.js that the getElementById funcitons are called and removed to edit the next slide.
